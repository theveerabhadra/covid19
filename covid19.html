		<li>The COVID-19 pandemic in India is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020</li>
		<li>India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia.[6] As of April 2021, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with more than 17 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and 195,123 deaths as of 26 April 2021</li>
		<li>The first cases of covid-19 in India were reported in the towns of Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasargod, all in the state of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan.</li>
		<li>Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane.</li>
		<li>On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.</li>
		<li>In July 2020, India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said that the country's case fatality rate was among the lowest in the world at 2.41% and was "steadily declining".</li>
		<li>Infection rates started to drop significantly in September, and the number of daily new cases and active cases started to decline rapidly.</li>
		<li>Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, and came down to below 15,000 in January 2021 before rising again under a second wave from March 2021. On 19 January 2021, nearly a year after the first reported case in India, Lakshadweep became the last region to report its first case.</li>
		<li>The second wave of cases was much larger than the first, and there were shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medicines in various parts of the country.</li>
	    <li>India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021, in what was described by The Hindu as the largest in the world.</li>
	    <li>India has authorised the British Oxfordâ€“AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield), the Indian BBV152 (Covaxin) vaccine, and the Russian Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use.</li>

		<li>In United States of America, from 3 January 2020 to 11:13am CEST, 29 April 2021, there have been 31,835,314 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 567,971 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 22 April 2021, a total of 223,293,713 vaccine doses have been administered.</li>
		<li>NEW YORK: The United States crossed the grim milestone of 500,000 deaths from Covid-19 on Monday, a year since announcing its first known death from the virus on February 29, 2020 in the Seattle area.</li>
		<li>Here, infectious disease experts Joseph Masci and Michele Halpern provide answers to some of the key questions.
		Masci, 70, is one of the leaders of Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, which was at the heart of New York's epidemic.Halpern is a specialist at the Montefiore hospital group in New Rochelle, a New York suburb where the epidemic arrived in force in February 2020.Prior to this pandemic, the United States observed coronaviruses "from a distance," explained Masci.</li>
        <li>There was SARS in Canada but very little or none in this country. There was no MERS here at all," he said."There was a lot of preparation made for Ebola coming to the United States, and it never really did."Suddenly this (coronavirus) was a problem where the United States was the epicenter."Masci said it was difficult to compare the United States with other countries.</li>
        <li>"I think smaller countries that had structured health care services had a good chance of bringing things into play quickly."In a country like ours, with 50 independent states, and a huge landmass, with largely a private hospital system, it is always going to be difficult to get everybody on board with one particular set of strategies," he explained.
        Masci added that Donald Trump's administration had a "haphazard approach", which did not help.</li>
        <li>"The fact that hospitals were competing with each other to get personal protective equipment didn't make sense. They had to centralize all of that very quickly and they didn't."It was a struggle to try to deal with those obstacles that were put up," he said.Masci and Halpern rue that mask-wearing was politicized."It's purely a health care issue," said Masci, adding that it is going to be difficult for the federal government to "reframe" that message.</li>
        <li>Halpern insists that people should not see mask-wearing as "infringing" on their freedom."There are other things we do routinely that you could say infringe our liberties like wearing a seatbelt or running through a red light," she said.</li>
        <li>According to the Johns Hopkins University tally, another 1,297 virus-related deaths were reported on Monday in the United States.For Masci, the most important lesson was to learn how to reconfigure hospitals to make them able to cope with a sudden influx of patients."Now... instead of 12 hot ICU beds, you have to have 150. Where do you get them? Who do you staff on with? So now we've learned this lesson." he said.</li>
        <li>Masci said the group of public hospitals of which Elmhurst is a part found strategies to distribute the burden among NYC's 11 public hospitals by transferring patients very quickly."We've turned from one hospital with 500 beds, to 11 hospitals with about 5,000 beds. It's worked very nicely."More generally, Halpern says the pandemic has made everyone realize that "hospitals need resources.""You have to invest in research, but you also have to invest in hospitals, in nursing homes. They have to have enough staff, they have to have the equipment that they need and the personnel has to be happy," she added.</li>
        <li>The epidemic has also sharply exposed inequalities, not just in health care but also in housing, with Black and Latino communities dying in disproportionately high numbers."We have to look at housing, and how it can be better suited to handling future epidemics. There are others coming," said Masci.</li>
        <li>Vaccines are rolling out but health experts are cautious due to uncertainties surrounding the British and South African variants of the virus. Masci says that if the variant strains don't turn into a huge problem and once we've reached the point where 70-80 percent of the population is vaccinated then "there's a good chance" we won't wear masks anymore."(But) suppose these variant strains do take hold, become more of a problem, are vaccine resistant, and we're all closing schools and putting masks and locking down again in a few months, (then) it's a lot harder to say by December,'We'll be out of the woods".Halpern says it's reassuring that the second wave was largely controlled, in New York at least."I have hopes that the vaccines will be effective and will tamper future waves. But it's hard to be sure whether our vaccines will be effective in the longer term, or on new variants. I don't think anyone knows that."So we have to be prepared that we're in this for a while," she said.</li>
        <li>In the long term, Masci says countries must not "fall into the trap" of forgetting about the pandemic once it has passed."We have to have a more meticulous global search for new pathogens because we're living in a time now where there is no, 'Something is happening in Asia and it's not going to happen in America.'"</li>

		<li>ritish enthusiasm for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has faded in the past month, reflecting rising unease about its possible links to rare adverse side effects, though overall UK confidence in vaccines is high, an updated survey has found.</li>
		<li>The survey of almost 5,000 people showed a significant increase in the proportion who said they want to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible, but also found that almost a quarter of those asked now believe the AstraZeneca vaccine causes blood clots - up from 13% last month.</li>
		<li>Reports of possible links to very rare blood clots have dented confidence in the AstraZeneca shot, which was developed with Oxford University scientists and shown in trials to be 76% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19.</li>
	    <li>More than a dozen European countries temporarily suspended its use after reports of blood clots combined with low platelets in a very small number of people who had received it. Many countries have resumed using the shot, but with some restrictions.</li>

		<li>The Australian Government has made a $1.7bn AUD ($1.24bn USD) supply and production agreement for COVID-19 vaccines: with the first doses set to come from AstraZenecaâ€™s vaccine in January 2021."</li>
		<li>The agreement concerns two potential vaccines: one from the University of Oxford / AstraZeneca; and the other from Australia's University of Queensland.</li>
		<li>The Australian Government pledges a free COVID-19 vaccine will be available progressively throughout 2021 in Australia.The total number of vaccines ordered by the government is based on a two dose per person regime.</li>
		<li>The doses will be almost entirely manufactured in Melbourne: the epicentre of Australia coronavirus outbreak.Two vaccine deal\u00a0Having entered Phase 3 trials, AstraZeneca AZD1222 viral vector vaccine would be available first: with 3.8 million doses lined up for Australia potentially as early as January and February.</li>
		<li> A total of 33.8 million vaccine doses will come from AstraZeneca.Australian biotechnology company CSL will manufacture around 30 million doses of this vaccine. The Australian Government will provide funding to support CSL as it readies for production: helping expand Australia on-shore manufacturing capabilities with specialised equipment, recruitment and training.Meanwhile, Australia will source 51 million doses from the University of Queensland\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.The University of Queensland is currently undertaking a Phase 1 clinical study on the recombinant protein vaccine (UQ-CSL V451) with CSL planning to take on a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in late 2020.</li>
		<li>Upon completion of successful clinical trials, CSL expects the first doses to be available by mid-2021.Building Australia's manufacturing capability While some other countries have signed vaccine supply in advance of Australia, the Australian Government says that its domestic manufacturing capability has allowed it to take the time to examine vaccine candidates around the world as they progress and select the most promising for its agreement today.</li>
		<li>Prime Minister Scott Morrison emphasised both vaccines will need to be proven safe and effective and meet all necessary regulatory requirements.There are no guarantees that these vaccines will prove successful: however, the agreement puts Australia at the top of the queue, if our medical experts give the vaccines the green light,he said.</li>
		<li>Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews added the agreements are a result of researchers and industry working together.The work we are doing now will also build our knowledge and strengthen our local manufacturing capability, which will grow our pharmaceutical and medtech sectors for the future,She said.</li>
		<li>CSL to lead production from Melbourne Australian biotechnology company CSL has signed heads of agreement with the Australian Government to supply 51 million doses of the University of Queensland vaccine. UQ-CSL V451 is a recombinant protein vaccine which uses CSL Seqirus proprietary adjuvant MF59.</li>
		<li>It has also signed heads of agreement with British/Swedish giant AstraZeneca for the expected manufacture of 30 million doses of the Oxford University AZD1222 vaccine.</li>
		<li>A funding deed with the Australian government will help ready its facilities for AZD1222 manufacture.In 2014 CSL opened its Biotechnology Manufacturing Facility in the Melbourne suburb of Broadmeadows, offering a world class facility that is one of the largest and most advanced of its kind in the southern hemisphere.</li>
		<li>Paul Perreault, CEO and Managing Director, CSL, said,We are pleased that we can produce the AZD11222 without compromising the production of our core products influenza vaccines and plasma and recombinant protein therapies \u2013 and provide a second option for a COVID-19 vaccine candidate to Australia.</li>
		<li>Acknowledging that CSL is the only company in Australia with manufacturing facilities capable of producing this vaccine, we thank the Australian Government for their support, ensuring Australia has access to onshore COVID-19 vaccine production and supply. Our facilities will require modifications in order to fulfil the compliance requirements for working with vector-based vaccines, as well as the addition of skilled personnel and further capital investment.
		<li>While there are still a number of milestones to be met, we are hopeful that by next year we will be in the fortunate position of having a vaccine candidate to support Australia and the world emergence from this crisis.</li>
